# From Alignment to Assignment: Frustratingly Simple but Effective Unsupervised Entity Alignment without Neural Networks

## Datasets

* ent_ids_1: ids for entities in source KG;
* ent_ids_2: ids for entities in target KG;
* ref_ent_ids: entity links encoded by ids;
* triples_1: relation triples encoded by ids in source KG;
* triples_2: relation triples encoded by ids in target KG;

## Word vectors

* please download the zip file from http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip and choose "glove.6B.300d.txt" as the word vectors.

## Environment

* Jupyter notebook
* tensorflow == 2.4.1
* Python == 3.6.5
* Numba
* Scipy
* Numpy
